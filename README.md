# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection system using PyTorch and TensorRT. It can be used to detect face masks both in images and in real-time video.

# Goal

The goal is to create a masks detection system, able to recognize face masks both in images, video and in real-time camera, drawing bounding box around faces. In order to do so, I  used for the Transfer Learning, particulalty I retrainded MobilenetV1 using the PyTorch framework.

# Technologies

- PyTorch
- TensorRT
- ONNX
- MobilenetV1-SSD
- Python

# Data
